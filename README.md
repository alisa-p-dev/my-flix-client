Welcome to the myFlix movie app front-end repository! This project complements the movie-api repository, which you can find at https://github.com/Skogab/Movie-App. The myFlix app is a web application tailored for movie enthusiasts, offering an engaging platform to explore, search, and uncover movies. Additionally, users can create profiles and manage their cherished movie selections.

**Setup**
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to your terminal and execute the command "npm install" to install the required dependencies. For local testing, initiate the application using "npm start".

**Goal**
The primary aim of this project was to construct the client-side component of the myFlix app using React, building upon the existing server-side code (REST API and database). The objective was to seamlessly merge server-side and client-side development. Together with the complementary half of the project, which utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack, this app was designed to offer a cohesive user experience.
